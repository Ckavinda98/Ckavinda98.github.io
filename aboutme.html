                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <h3>Dialog Axiata PLC 2023 (Jan-July)</h3>
                <p>Position : Developer </p>
                <p>During my internship at Dialog Axiata, I took a leading role in developing the Dashboard for
                    AWS Elastic Service. Throughout this project, I actively engaged in both front-end and backend aspects. I employed the React.js library for front-end development, focusing particularly
                    on visualizing intricate details of the Elastic Service obtained from the RestAPI.
                    In the backend, I established connections using the Spring Boot framework and Java, linking
                    with DynamoDB via Proxy and VPN to ensure secure and efficient data communication.
                    The culmination of this effort is a Dashboard equipped with several functions, including the
                    capability to save emails in the database through RestAPI.</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>React: Utilized React to build a modern and interactive user interface,
                             providing a seamless user experience and efficient data rendering.</li>
                        <li>Tailwind CSS: Leveraged Tailwind CSS for streamlined and efficient styling, 
                            allowing for rapid UI development and consistent design across the application.</li>
                        <li>Spring Boot: Employed Spring Boot to build a scalable and performant backend, 
                            facilitating the implementation of business logic and integration with various systems.</li>
                        <li>RESTful APIs: Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend components,
                             ensuring efficient data transfer and interaction.</li>
                        <li>DynamoDB: Implemented email functionality by storing data in DynamoDB,
                             leveraging its capabilities for efficient data storage and retrieval</li>
                        <li>VPN and Proxy: Configured VPN and proxy settings to ensure secure data retrieval,
                             enabling access to external resources and protecting sensitive information. 
                             Established VPN connections using the rasdial command line for seamless and
                              secure data access through the VPN.</li>
                        <li>Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams,
                             following agile development methodologies to deliver 
                            high-quality solutions that met business requirements and exceeded customer expectations.</li>
